# Web API JavaScript Quiz

## Description
I built a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

<li>When you click the start button, then a timer starts and you are presented with a question.

<li>When you answer a question, then you are presented with another question.

<li>When you answer a question incorrectly, then time is subtracted from the clock.

<li>When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, then the game is over.

<li>When the game is over,then you can save your initials and score.
